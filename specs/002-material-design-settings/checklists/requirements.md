# Specification Quality Checklist: Material Design Settings Window

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec explicitly names MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit in the Background and Assumptions sections — this is intentional and appropriate since the toolkit choice is the entire premise of the feature, not an implementation detail to hide
- FR-014 through FR-018 explicitly protect the `001` structural contract from accidental regression
- SC-001 ("identify as Material Design without prompting") is qualitative but verifiable by visual inspection against the Material Design specification
